        "In this short tutorial, we will explore how to use **Jaqpotpy**, a Python client for the **Jaqpot** platform. Jaqpot is a cloud-based platform that allows scientists to easily train, validate, and deploy machine learning models, especially in fields like **chemistry**, **toxicology**, and **risk assessment**.\n",

        "- Using **chemical descriptors** from SMILES (a textual representation of molecules)\n",
        "- Training a model via the **Jaqpot API**\n",
        "- Making predictions with the trained model"

It defines the chemical space within which the model's predictions are considered reliable. DOA ensures that the model is applied only to compounds similar to those in the training dataset, reducing the risk of inaccurate predictions for out-of-scope molecules. By incorporating DOA, QSAR models become more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy for decision-making in drug discovery and toxicology."
